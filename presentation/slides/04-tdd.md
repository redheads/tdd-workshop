**now** you know the **tooling**!

---

Let's use **testing** to **DRIVE** our **development**!

---

## Recap: Traditional approach

- Design
- Imlementation
- Test

---

### Drawbacks when writing tests at end

- low test coverage
- late testing: rethink problem
- knowledge of implementation: changes how tests are written
- not automated

---

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Design
- Test
- Implementation

---

## TDD Workflow

- Red
- Green
- Refactor

---

- no code without test
- untested code should not go live
- baby steps: only write code to make test pass

---

## green bar pattern 

- "fake it til you make it"
- triangulation
- obvious implementation

---

### Advantages of TDD

- high test coverage
- increases modularity
- improves maintainability
- implicit documentation
