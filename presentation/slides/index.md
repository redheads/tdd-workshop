## What should we test?

---

## What should we test?

- **focus on user stories**, not on technical details
- **often evokes better design!**

---

Let's code!

Let's code!

---

**now** you know the **tooling**!

---

Let's use **testing** to **DRIVE** our **development**!

## Recap: Traditional approach

- Design
- Imlementation
- Test

---

### Drawbacks when writing tests at end

- low test coverage
- late testing -> rethink problem
- knowledge of implementation -> changes how tests are written
- not automated

---

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Design
- Test
- Implementation

---

## TDD Workflow

- Red
- Green
- Refactor

---

- no code without test
- untested code should not go live
- baby steps -> only write code to make test pass

---

starting with the Fizz-Buzz Kata

---

when we're done

- outside-in
- inside-out
